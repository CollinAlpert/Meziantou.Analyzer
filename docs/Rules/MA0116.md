# MA0116 - Return Task instead of awaiting it

This Roslyn Analyzer informs developers usages of the async/await pattern where, instead of awaiting a ``Task``, it could be returned directly.\
This is improves the code's performance, since the compiler doesn't need to generate a state machine for the async method and awaiting the resulting ``Task`` is deferred to the caller.\
Here's a few methods where this analyzer kicks in:
```c#
public async Task RunAsync() {
    await Task.Delay(1000);
}

public async Task RunAsync() {
    var random = Random.Shared.Next();
    if(random % 2 == 0) {
        await Task.Delay(1000).ConfigureAwait(false);
        return;
    }

    await DoSomethingAsync();
}

public async Task<int> RunAsync() {
    var random = Random.Shared.Next();
    if(random % 2 == 0) {
        return await GetSomeValueAsync();
    }

    return await GetSomeOtherValueAsync();
}
```
After applying the code fix which the analyzer supplies, these methods would be transformed to the following:
```c#
public Task RunAsync() {
    return Task.Delay(1000);
}

public Task RunAsync() {
    var random = Random.Shared.Next();
    if(random % 2 == 0) {
        return Task.Delay(1000);
    }

    return DoSomethingAsync();
}

public Task<int> RunAsync() {
    var random = Random.Shared.Next();
    if(random % 2 == 0) {
        return GetSomeValueAsync();
    }

    return GetSomeOtherValueAsync();
}
```
The analyzer will not report when a ``Task`` is awaited within a `try` or a `using` block.
